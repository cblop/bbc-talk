# Generative vs Interactive narratives

---
layout: false

# Generative narratives

- No pre-written story or narrative exists.
- The narrative emerges as a result of a series of complex interactions in the game.
- This tends to happen in sandbox-style, open-world games
- Examples: Civilisation, Dwarf Fortress, some MMORPGs

---
class: inverse, center

![Default-aligned-image](img/civ.png)

---

## Interactive (non-linear) narratives

- The narrative is pre-written with several branches
- Player's interactions decide which branches play out

# Vladimir Propp

![Default-aligned-image](img/propp.jpg)

# Propp's story functions

31 story functions, including:

- _Absentation_: One of the members of a family absents himself from home.
- _Interdiction_: An interdiction is addressed to the hero.
- _Complicity_: The victim submits to deception and thereby unwittingly helps his enemy.
- _Villainy_: The villain causes harm or injury to a member of the family.

<!-- Punch and Judy image -->

---
layout: false

# Why Punch and Judy?

- Extremely simple story domain
- Simple, well-defined characters
- Variable set of outcomes
- Audience interaction


---

# P&J Scene Using Propp

1. Joey tells Punch to look after the sausages (_interdiction_).
2. Joey has some reservations, but decides to trust Punch (_complicity_).
3. Joey gives the sausages to Punch (_provision or receipt of a magical agent_).
4. Joey leaves the stage (_absentation_).
5. A crocodile enters the stage and eats the sausages (_violation_).
6. Punch fights with the crocodile (_struggle_).
7. Joey returns to find that the sausages are gone (_return_).

# Implementation

Three layers:

- narrative manager (institution)
- multi-agent system (emotional agents)
- environment (animation)

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Institutions

Modelling stories as 'social' norms.

---

# Institutions

- An institution describes the story world as social norms
- Says what characters are _permitted_ and _obliged_ to do
- Characters can deviate from these norms, but at a cost

---

# Institutions: ASP

- ASP: Answer Set Programming
- Describes the story world
- Timeline of events as input
- Solver works out what permissions and obligations hold next

---

# Emotions

Valence, arousal and dominance

---

# VAD

- valence: positive/negative
- arousal: excited/bored
- dominance: dominant/submissive

# Every Object Tells a Story

![Default-aligned-image](img/bishopspalace.jpg)

---

# Every Object Tells a Story

- TSB-funded project between Sysemia Ltd, University of Bath and the Bishop's Palace in Wells

---

# What is it?

- Person walks around the exhibition space with a tablet device
- Bluetooth LE beacons (iBeacons) are used to get their location
- They are given options and recommendations based on where they go and what they do
- BUT: in a narrative-y way

---

# Bluetooth LE beacons

<!-- pic would be nice -->

- Work like radio beacons (but using Bluetooth LE)
- Just send out a signal
- Distance from beacon is based on signal strength

---

# Design

- Resembles a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book
- Story is told in the second person
- Three types of action: _visit_, _examine_ and _ask_.
- Actions are stored as a list of events

---

# Recommendations

- Introduced in the context of the narrative
- Example:
  > _"You remember someone in the local pub telling you about this painting of Bishop Jocelyn. She suggested also looking at the chair he used, which is in the Bishop's house."_

---
# How are facts stored?

- RDF semantics (subject-predicate-object triples)
- Stored in JSON-LD format
- schema.org ontology for simplicity

---
# Event Calculus solver

<!-- get ref for this -->

- The Event Calculus describes how events happen over time using mathematical logic
- This allows us to reason about what may or may not be true at a certain point in time

---

# The Event Calculus

- _Fluents_ are properties that are true or false.
- Events _occur_, which _initiate_ or _terminate_ fluents at instants in time
- A fluent _holds_ (is true) at a point in time if it has been initiated, but not terminated.

---

# Implementation details

- Runs on Nexus 7 tablet
- HTML based, Cordova app
- Coded in Clojurescript
- Clojurescript's core.logic for Event Calculus
