# Generative narratives

- No pre-written story or narrative exists.
- The narrative emerges as a result of a series of complex interactions in the game.
- This tends to happen in sandbox-style, open-world games
- Examples: Civilisation, Dwarf Fortress, some MMORPGs

## Interactive (non-linear) narratives

- The narrative is pre-written with several branches
- Player's interactions decide which branches play out

# Propp's story functions

31 story functions, including:

- _Absentation_: One of the members of a family absents himself from home.
- _Interdiction_: An interdiction is addressed to the hero.
- _Complicity_: The victim submits to deception and thereby unwittingly helps his enemy.
- _Villainy_: The villain causes harm or injury to a member of the family.

<!-- Punch and Judy image -->

layout: false

# Why Punch and Judy?

- Extremely simple story domain
- Simple, well-defined characters
- Variable set of outcomes
- Audience interaction

---

# Implementation

Three layers:

- narrative manager
- multi-agent system
- environment (animation)
